# Distinctiveness and Uniqueness:
The project allows a registered user to create blogs and add images or videos.
This requires the user to be grabbed in the author field of the posts model.

# What each file contains
The templates directories contain html files, the static directory contains css and javascript files.
The posts directory contains the post app. The users directory contains the users app.
The djangoproject directory contains the overall settings of the app.

# Design approach
I created one model: posts which defines the structure of a post in the databases.
